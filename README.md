1. Go to [https://nmbo.app](https://nmbo.app). 
2. Create a new checklist or open a previous one.
3. Copy the link and share it.

That's it. No account or download needed. Anybody with the link to the checklist can immediately start adding or completing tasks. 

## Stack

NMBO is made with `React` for the frontend, `Next.js` for server-side rendering, `Bulma` for the stylized components, `Firebase` (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions) for the backend, and `Google Analytics`.
